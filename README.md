## Installation

To run the frontend:

1. #### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone
cd PHASE-2-FINAL-PROJECT
```

2. #### Set up JSON Server:

Ensure you have JSON server installed. If not, install it using npm:

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

3. #### Create db.json file:

A db.json file was provided containing the 10 objects containing the title, artist name, image, year, likes, price of artwork, artworks sold and details of each artwork. Here is an example:

```bash
    {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "Starry Night",
      "artist": "Vincent van Gogh",
      "image": "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQoiXokZHJc3iND6Uqax-iQ-nU6PmC5lRPqIw&s",
      "year": 1889,
      "likes": 8,
      "price": 5000,
      "sold": false,
      "detail": " Starry Night is one of Vincent van Gogh's most iconic paintings, created in 1889. It depicts a swirling night sky over a tranquil village, with bold, expressive brushstrokes capturing the motion of the stars and the moon. The scene is framed by a dark cypress tree in the foreground, contrasting against the vibrant, star-filled sky. This masterpiece is celebrated for its emotional intensity, innovative use of color, and dramatic brushwork, reflecting van Gogh's turbulent state of mind and his fascination with the cosmos."
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "title": "Mona Lisa",
      "artist": "Leonardo da Vinci",
      "image": "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ0s5B5TIgNtd8NBG31BBu2v1cCxIZi3AEE2g&s",
      "year": 1503,
      "likes": 10,
      "price": 100000,
      "sold": false,
      "detail": "The Mona Lisa is a portrait painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci, completed between 1503 and 1506. The artwork depicts a woman with an enigmatic expression, famously known for her subtle smile. It is renowned for its sophisticated use of sfumato‚Äîa technique that creates a soft, gradual transition between colors and tones. The painting is housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris and is considered one of the most iconic and celebrated artworks in the world. The identity of the woman in the portrait, often believed to be Lisa Gherardini, remains a topic of debate and intrigue."
    }
```
#### 4. Run the JSON server:
Start the server by running the following command in the project directory:

```bash
json-server --watch db.json

```

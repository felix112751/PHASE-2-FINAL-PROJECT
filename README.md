      "artist": "Vincent van Gogh",
      "image": "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQoiXokZHJc3iND6Uqax-iQ-nU6PmC5lRPqIw&s",

      "price": 5000,
      "sold": false,
      "detail": " Starry Night is one of Vincent van Gogh's most iconic paintings, created in 1889. It depicts a swirling night sky over a tranquil village, with bold, expressive brushstrokes capturing the motion of the stars and the moon. The scene is framed by a dark cypress tree in the foreground, contrasting against the vibrant, star-filled sky. This masterpiece is celebrated for its emotional intensity, innovative use of color, and dramatic brushwork, reflecting van Gogh's turbulent state of mind and his fascination with the cosmos."
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "title": "Mona Lisa",

The artwork depicts a woman with an enigmatic expression, famously known for her subtle smile. It is renowned for its sophisticated use of sfumatoâ€”a technique that creates a soft, gradual transition between colors and tones. The painting is housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris and is considered one of the most iconic and celebrated artworks in the world. The identity of the woman in the portrait, often believed to be Lisa Gherardini, remains a topic of debate and intrigue."
